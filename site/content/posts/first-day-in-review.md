### Victories:

I got this website up and it is working fairly well. I now have an easy space to jot my thoughts.



### Criticisms:

I procrastinated a bit with formatting, etc. Ended up deciding it was not important half way through and chucked out a bunch of 'progress'. What I have is good enough to move forward with my actual goals.

Didn't do any reinforcement learning related stuff.
