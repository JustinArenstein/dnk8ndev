This week has seen a lot of time sunk into exploring the career landscape.\
\
Over the weekend I managed to read the fourth chapter of [The RL book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). I must say, I am pretty confused. Might not be picking this stuff up as naturally as I hope. Maybe [The RL course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) will reinforce concepts.\
\
Back to career searching, I have noticed trends of what in general employers want (with respect to Machine/Reinforcement Learning jobs)

* Degree in STEM field (some don't specify degree at all, others expect an MSc/MEng, others a PhD!)
* Proven record of working in research environment, sometimes high impact research publications desired.
* Understanding of linear algebra, probabilistic methods, geometry processing, statistics, calculus
* Demonstrated experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, data science, algorithm design, optimization, numerical methods
* Python coding with strong engineering practices
* C/C++ coding comes up almost as often as Python
* Experience in Multi-threaded and parallel/distributed computing
* Contribution to open-source projects
* Experience in Linux environment
* Experience with a deep learning framework, PyTorch being the most in fashion
* Experience with CUDA/OpenCL/OpenGL
* Docker/Kubernetes sometimes comes up (as well as DevOps experience)
* Experience with physics engines (simulations) such as MuJoCo



Still a long way to go until I meet all criteria. Just have to balance the act of applying to positions just within my reach with continuous learning so that I may fulfill most of these criteria.\

Hopefully next week will bring more progress in RL (although I am relocating back to Cape Town so maybe not!).
