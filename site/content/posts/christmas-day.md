Because it is Christmas, I am going to take it a bit easy. I don't have family close by to spend it with (we are going to celebrate in January when we return home to Cape Town). So other than a little Christmas stocking opening this morning, with my girlfriend Chard*Ã©*, it is a normal day for me.\
\
Today is one of my last days to polish things up for one of my clients (contract ends end of December, scary!). So going to do that. It is an interesting project but another example of taking time away from my long-term goals of breaking into a reinforcement learning centered job.

Once done with that, I am going to resume the RL course I am busy doing.\
\
Then I should have enough time to relax this evening once she is back from work (she got the Christmas day shift at the hospital and is on call until the morning of the 26th!).
