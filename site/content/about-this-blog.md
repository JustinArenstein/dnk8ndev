title: About this blog
slug: about

I am a tech enthusiast. Generalist up until now, but I found the area I wish to specialize in, Reinforcement Learning, and this blog is recording the process of deliberately aiming my mind toward my intentions and desires.\
\
I hope that in years to come, once I have achieved my goals it could serve someone in similar shoes.

This blog is going to be very specific to my career progression. At times I may blog about other things in my life but they would fall under different categories.
