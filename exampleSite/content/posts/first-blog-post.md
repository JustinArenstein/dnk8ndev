It starts today.\
\
I plan to take small steps in the right direction rather than moving fast in every direction. The source of inspiration is from an [answer to 'If you only had 15 minutes to sharpen your mind every day, what should you do?'](https://www.quora.com/If-you-only-had-15-minutes-to-sharpen-your-mind-every-day-what-should-you-do/answer/Jeremy-Hadfield?ch=10&share=cd338530&srid=bl2I1&fbclid=IwAR1cUX_pcqmMoYjeAe822yqYRtB7qO5CuAGkVN4Vst1EEXA4YkFfbWSLFCc).\

This is the first post in a series of posts, categorized under the following headings:

* **daily-focus**

  To begin each day, I write a bit on my daily focus. Something I can commit to. I won't commit to writing a post under this series every day but I will aim to do it as much as possible
* **day-in-review**

  At the end of each day, I write a bit on challenges faced, progress made, and things which I turned down that did not help me go the direction I am headed. Again, I won't commit to such posts but it is in my (and potentially future readers') interest to maintain this discipline.
* **week-in-review**

  At the end of each week, I write a bit of a higher level post on the week just past. I will endeavor to make a commitment to writing a post under this section.

My goal is to break into the Reinforcement learning field. This is going to include courses studied, text books, open-source contributions and other side projects.

I am going to attempt to describe what I don't understand so that when I do eventually understand and it all seems simple, I can look back and note that once upon a time it was not so simple.\

I hope that this can motivate others who find themselves in a similar situation.
